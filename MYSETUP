#How to run on my /nobackup

# 1. run the .loadenv1 from the home directory

# 2. load py270 environment

# 3. use my nice pipeline as per final_bash scripts

##### I must make generic versions of these scripts then push them to github #####
#For samples 1 - 28 and 64 I have copied the 'aftertrinity.sh' bash that is working into the amples folders as 
'aftertrinity_NEW'. This is the same as the copy on my repositiory from 15/05 but needed a different name 
because there is already an old aftertrinity.sh in these folders.
